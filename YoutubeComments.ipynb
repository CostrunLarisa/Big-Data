for hating on the guy because nowadays i actually enjoy his songs even if i dont listen to them that muchhonestly lets be honest we were all just following the media and listening to what are friends said who were also just following the media its cool this guy kept up his music hes seriously gotten better and seems like a really chill dude compared to the cancer that exists today this song isnt even half bad 2010 people had no idea what would come as internet became more mainstream fun fact  many people are here to watch the no of dislikes after watching sadak 2s dislikes esta cancon me trae recuerdos del mundial de sudafrica 2010 es solo eso  random people who like this will become a millionaire someday im here after seeing disliked of sadak2 trailar anyone else i dont no why this song has been hated so much there are nostalgia feeling cool clip and music the amount of hate and dislikes in this song turned justin into a different person or should i rather say he matured rapidly in just 10yrs i still respect jb he has gained alot of achievements anyways lets admit it that this song is hella when it was released the fact that everybody hate justin because he has so many fans than any celebrities whos randomly reading the comments in november 2019 funfact you came here to see how many dislikes this has justin bieber is a legendary singer  i love him and i really hope that he can reach out the toppest level so that no can even dare to imagine a position like that just imagine who is here everyday 10m dislikes and 10m likes perfectly balanced as all things should be i genuinely do not understand why there are so many dislikes for this video this song is bop  when your middle school crush rejects you be like cad os brasileiros ouvindo nessa quarentena algum em dois

and you too 9 years later you think theyre still shuffling to this day everyone was shuffling when this song came out 2020 and nobody knows who is under the golden robot head this is gonna be the streets on new years when 2020 is gone there are over 592k comments here and if you manage to find my comment you are a true legend woww thank u for a the likes guys may god bless back when guys would wear skinny jeans that looked like they were meant for girls i wish they got back together again this used to be the only song i listened t  2011 you are done with school and this song is playing no stress no worries and no pandemic is going on you simply sit back relax and enjoy the song fun fact the first viewer on this song is this video makereditor this song made everyone in grade school hyped even if they were having the worst day nostalgia yo folks yall should do shuffle dance when the pandemics over the people shuffiling and spreading it is how corona is spreading 9  years later if youre watching this youre a legend essa msica me lembra alvin e os esquilos only people who didnt come from tik tok can like this comment sometimes nostalgia is great dont get me wrong but also a reality check to see how your so called friends that said they never switched up on you in the future do  it sucks bc its memories like these that remind of you those goofy moments you had with them which you wish you could go back to bc sadly that was the last time you truly felt happy also on a side note when im 60 or 70 im gonna put this on for my grand kids  be like what yall know about this then start shuffling lmfao this song harlem shake and gangnam style literally set the tone for all of 20102015 imagine there are songs which have more clicks tf how mybe after the covid 19 the world

national anthem this is gonna be everyone after the corona virus pandemic is over the first guy that commented this video feels like the best thing in the world  now watch theyre gonna predict october 2020 little did they know thats how 2020 america would look nostalgia  i miss when everything was like this i only got a taste of it too young to truly enjoy it too old to just forget it kids nowadays would never understand the impact this songs had on us when it first came out this brings back serious memories of being like 7 sitting on the floor and listening to this song on the tv a lot of fortnite players werent even born when this came out who here remembers the good memories and then think of this song this is still amazing 9 years later and will always be legendary lmfao come back  this video is such a large part of my childhood too much nostalgia lies within this video                 after the pandemic this song would be the song of century  lol legend says they are still shuffling till this day youtube is the closest thing we will ever get to a time machine was on a nostalgic trip and couldnt forget this everybody stay postive lets change this world lets start a trend everyone start playing this song everywhere spread it everybody start shuffling and soon well be back to partying and looking like this  kids nowadays would never understand the impact this songs had on us when it first came out i remembered when this song was 10 minutes ago and now its 9 years ago so this is how the covid vaccine will be distributed its weird how songs can just take you back to a moment in time outta no where they made the best song of the decade and just disappeared me still doesnt know what lmfao means i think i forgot  restructure  restructure these guys straight up made 3

the biggest nostalgia tracks of the century 18 billion views and 9 years later this is still a hit this song ruled the world for a good while legends says that they still shufling reminds me of that

fifth harmony i fun fact the first viewer on this song is this video makereditor unpopular opinion  quarantine makes old songs popular again in my humble opinion laurens part is without a doubt the best who else just randomly listening old song because of home quarantine who just randomly came to this song in august i really dont know why im waching this at 2020 good memories 117 only people who saw his eyes are green can like this comment harmonizer stream worth it lets make it 2billion before 2020 ends we can do this it took me 5 years to realise that camila isnt wearing a tie its her skin the title should be  fifth harmonyworth it official music video ftkid ink and camila cabello normani was 19 years old when this came out aqui est o comentrio em portugus que voc tanto procura remember when no one and literally no one would shut up about this song miss those days  anyone else in 2021 listening this song so beautiful that touch deeply the heart of people i pray who ever reads this becomes successful this song is so catchy people i am not a fifth harmony fan im a mixers just visiting and i love the battle salute vs worth it im feeling really bad because camila is exited from fifth harmony  i liked fifth harmony because of her when this song came out i was 9 and absolutely secure that dinah and beyonce were the same person random people who like this become a millionaire someday how many people are here 5 years later cant believe its an old song now feels like yesterday this song will never gets old i deny the fact that this song is 5 year old who just came here

was with fifth harmony 1 people who are reading this may you a billionaire one day im literally on a marathon of old songs   the memories real life hitting different thoo  whats weird tho is that camila gust left the group for good reasons and is more popular on her own than the rest of the 5h together i think laurens part is the best and she nailed it anyway you barely hear lauren in the song

mature content singers these days collab without even checking if their voice is good all together thats why most of the songs are just nahh this song proves the old good days are better than now jk this is just 3 years old but still a bop 3 idk why but this song is so good  povsome parts are filmed in tekashis house i mean idk i just discovered this music one miute ago lets be honest now this song was already a hit way before lisa covered it in the quarantine the humans have time to relax and find out a other side a side with good music and minds warning dont even think to watch this song with your family  i didnt even he sang this i just came here from lisa swalla dance most of tiktokers are cringe but he is an exception  the fact that they danced on that water and didnt slip is just i could never the part then nicky singer she looks smokin hotel who else sang drake instead of drunk  if you listen this song after 3yrs then you are a legend i cant be the only one who knows this song ever since it was released these were the good times musically rice and we all thought he said drake that moment when jason used to be an artist now his just making tiktok songs lets see how many people watch this during quarrantine fun fact madison beer performed background vocals for the song gnt s eu q achei a nicki mt sumida dps d 2018 ela sumiu nunca mais vi as msicas dela fazer fama

tuvieron que separar una cancin de reggaeton que no habla de sexo esto vale oro yo escucho msicas de michael jackson when you have to pick your project partner but your friend choose someone else ima tell my kids this was katy perry and the joker theres 582k comments if you find mine you are legend  i hope youll be millionaire one day hes in every song you cant see him cause he is camouflage to the background funny how he disappeared hes literally his song title these days hes literally somebody that we used to know who else started listening to old songs randomly everyone gangsta till the wall tells you that he used to know you is anybody watching in september 2020 yes we are and we will forever my girlfriend said this song sucked now shes single when your minecraft girlfriend dies and respawns in your friends bed he doesnt make music anymore now your just somebody that i used to know i used to think my life was a tragedy the good old days  this comment is the only thing youll ever know about me this comment is the first and last time well cross paths in life you probably wont see me other comment sections or anywhere else in general so i would just like to say good luck and have fun the worlds the limit an no one can stop you from what you love no matter what you do in life the worst case is you try your best you be yourself and do what you can do with compassion honesty effort and understanding and it goes worst case and then you move on like everything else i am very upset that tiktok had to ruin this this is such a memorable song for me i remember when this came out shitfolks we getting old now hes the guy that we used to know 8 years and the camera quality is still better than pewdiepies camera quality  especially in these depressing and dark times  that they shouldnt be together a toxic relationship which is an all to real thing she said that they could be friends  which is a good idea in theory but in practice is just so wrong she treats him like a stranger and ignores everything he keeps bugging her not a good idea  struggles that she endured with him  their relationship must have been going on for a while i think thats the number one reason why she didnt break up sooner she felt if they just let it die down  or the sadness of how we cant go back to it she wanted to be friends some people werent satisfied with a single like so the turned their screen upside down and hit it again my kids will know this as the song that made joker life was so different when this came out i wish that one day gotye listens to my music and we make a hit song together god bless everyone better days are coming remember when this song was on the radio every day dear stranger whoever reads this may your mother live over 100 years cant fooking belive that this was made 9 years ago the fact that this comment section is still active after 8 years is lit the people who disliked are actually sayingdis i like just like a fellow tik tok song artist said lol get the bread then leave plot twist he forgot his youtube account password anybody else shocked this song was from 2011 it felt like yesterday i was listening to this on the radio im gonna go make my coffee and if this isnt the top comment when i come back now your just somebody that we use to know  why do us like that when you find a hopper under your minecraft chest this guy had one hit song and that was it now hes just somebody that we used to know he looks like an younger version of the joker mano s eu que escuto por causa da intro antiga do rezendeevil kkkkkj essa msica descreve todo o meu relaciomento no decorrer de 2 anos e  triste eu t triste ainda he just straight up went to the grocery store to get some milk after this this guy just made a song naked and left forever the fact that i still see recent comments shows how much this song banged idk how one human could possibly dislike this song 2 of people who are watching this comment i wish their parents still alive for more than 100 years  god bless you this hits diferent when you re not a child anymore who else is getting this recommended no matter how many times you refresh cant believe this is the same kimbra that half alive featured who is here beaucuze ronaldo from huis streams i really love this song nostalgia is a big plus gotye made this song and forgot his youtube password this man looks like the joker so bad he about to kill murray this man made one song then fell off the face of the earth now i know why the joker looked to familiar he looks like somebody i used to know my mans dropped the fattest banger in history and dipped ok an unoriginal comment i know but i love this song only what we need in 2020 is gotye to come back now hes just a singer that we used to know  am i the only one who just realized that this guy looks like joaquin phoenix i remenber when gotye was the most famous person on earth now hes just somebody we used to know this song and clover cage  on my mind are the only two things keeping me sane through these tough times i just want to send love to everyone and i want everyone to know things will get better everyone gangsta until youre just somebody that they used to know wondering wheres the girl now shes so pretty her voice is so soft huehue who else started listening to old songs randomly fun fact this wasnt in your recommended you searched for this the way the song sounds until the chorus hits youd think why is this song so empty its funny how hes just somebody we used to know why do the 80s feel so close but the early 2000s feel so far away shids tough he left because he is the joker now now hes just somebody that we used to know pov its 9 years later and this was in your recommended his dentist was somebody that he used to know he made one song we treted him like stranger now hes sombody that we used to know why did everyone just suddenly search up this song again this song is getting me through the friendzone with this amazing girl that i known for a long time and i want to be more and start something new i just wish she would see the same but love is a two lane street ill still be there being her happiness like she did for me if shes happy or i can make someones day brighter then am happy and thats the only thing thats keeping me going  it amazes me that people disliked this music 30 voice 20 showing young bodies 20 good acting 30 who is watching it now its literally from 9 years ago did we all just collectively decide to listen to this song at random why does this feel like it was made last year now hes just sombody that we used to know he dropped one more song and then dipped now hes just somebody that we used to know this guy is just somebody that we used to know now hes just somebody that we used to know  this song helped me get over a lot of things whats funny is im the one thats ghosted people in the end i hurt the person i loved very much listening to this made me so sad i cant imagine what i made that person

tomorrow to my oldest son i mean most unrealistic ducks go to acid how is this song three years old for people who dont know what ryan lewis does he is macklemores dj 2020 is the throwback songs year because everyone wants to feel like the early 10s again while stuck in quarantine tiktok sucks youtube is the closest thing we will ever get to a time machine clothes lookin tacky hair lookin wacky thrift shoppin makes me happy i just wanted to hear this song again and now i realized that today is the 8th anniversary of the song crazy how time flies that moment when you come back to a song and your english has improved enough to actually understand the lyrics im like yo thats 50 dollars for a tshirt seb tabuses 8 years wow i grew up listening to his music as a child i never realised how comical this song is i cant believe that i used to sing this with a straight face  for those of you who werent around 7 years ago this was our old town road when youve grown up and you understand the lyrics its september 2020 and this dude got 20 dollars in his pocket i feel bad for the generations that wont get to hear this amazing song for the 1 of people reading this i hope you become successful in your life anyone going through nostalgic songs because 2020 sucks  the dislikes are from the people wh only have 19 in their pocket this song and clover cage  secret admirer are the two songs keeping me sane through these tough times i just want to send love to everyone and i want everyone to know things will get better we are in this together if u here this song in 2020 quarantine during online class then u have gud song taste who else is randomly listening to old songs im still waiting for the perfect opportunity to quote im like yo thats 50 dollars for a tshirt in a conversation how is this 8 years old this is a money management guide disguised as a dope song when a rappers singing about money but you can actually relate if anyone who talk to you dont know this song then just walk away just imagine how many peoples come here everyday during september 2020 parabens soldados vcs acharam a musica que ficava tocando em quanto passava a trend dos signos e etc continuem assim saudaes only people who didnt come from tiktok can like this this song is gonna get another billion views in another 7 years everyone watching this has spent 50 on a tshirt fun fact this is not your first time coming here  if you were alivee back in the day u were the last of the elites stop asking whos still listening in 2020 we never stopped listening they changed the start of the song they cut out the boy asking hey macklemore can we go thrift shopping this video is 8 years ago and it has better quality than 2020 cctv s yeah lets normalize being mildly trashy but still keeping it classy please uhm hes from the pnw 20 here in seattle will get you a pair of jeans one word nostalgia it brought me here me 8 years later im gonna pop some tags i will never get tired of this song the dislikes are from people that had 19 dollars in their pocket like who came here after listening on tik tok  20 dollars in my pocket this could be released in 2020 and we wouldnt notice it dont lie everybody is listening old songs during quarantaine fun fact  youre binge watching nostalgic songs right now this just looks like they had a lot of fun noticing he has the same vans as me oml i didnt know the exact same were a trend that long ago they didnt become popular again since vsco girls wows my mom when its black friday quarantine made me a legend this song and clover cage  on my mind are the two songs keeping me sane through these tough times i just want to send love to everyone and i want everyone to know things will get better we are in this together i still got that 20 dollars just stole everything i probably shud have washed these  210 this man look like tyler joseph or josh dun from twenty one pilots remember my middle school bought some shoe and t shirt from thrift shop and lookin for 8090s fashionstyle xd whos here in 2020 back to the future this song was such a hit he must have at least 21 now 8 years later and im still listening to this song wow its

quarantine thanks in advance damn 8 years its still an unforgettable song macklemore goes to the gucci store realizes nothing is for 20  wips out five more 20 notes i bought a lambo whit only 20

meredith grey do when shes not at the hospital i cant believe this jewel is turning 5 years today times flies only people who didnt come from tiktok are worthy of liking this comment fun fact  the whole world was listening to this 5 years ago unpopular opinion this should be a movie that is directed by taylor swift written by taylor swift owned by taylor swift  and stares taylor swift im still wondering as to why this was never made into a movie like we couldve had bad blood oceans 8 and charlis angels somebody needs to make this happen like now plz when she did all of thoose tricksme goes to hospital after doing dangerous tricks  that meredith from greys anatomy is luna is gard to believe just when she nods at taylor i can see that when you find out taylor is not friend with half of them now but she is friend with katy even zendaya is in this too many famous people i returned here after gigi confirmed her pregnancy i remember when i first watched this i didnt recognise anyone but taylor for the people whos listening to this song after 5 years your a legend was i the only one who didnt know anyone except taylor and selena in this video back when it was released  the most fierce woman in the world is taylor lets be honest  zendaya had the most iconic scene im having a taylor swift marathon quarantine edition who else is with me imagine how upset you would be if you were in a boxing match and your opponent is just singing a comeback like this in 2020 would shock the world for weeks we all agree that zendaya looked the most badass in this mv who else is watching after they realized ellen pompeo is in this whys no one talking about how much this sounds like power by little mix in quarantine and still think this would have been a boss movie excuse mee i hate how there is a big machine label at the end of the vid am i the only one who thinks this would be a really good movie people i recognize taylor swift kendrick lamar selena gomez hailee steinfeld gigi hadid ellie goulding zendaya cara delevigne karlie kloss and hayley williams almost 5 years later this music video is still iconic i watched this so many times a while back i was like 8 or 9 im 11 nowww cant believe i didnt even know half of these celebrities back then taylor really has an eye that recognizes talent did anyone else notice that slayz bulldog was the one who also appeared in the end game mv when this was still new i recognized only taylor same for anyone likee cant wait to see katy sings bad blood and taylor sings swish swish  dang taylor swift selena gomez hailee steinfeld gigi hadid and ellie goulding 5 1d excurrent gfs in one music video i did not realize so many famous people were in thislike zendaya and meredith lets be honest this music video was ahead of its time only people who listen during quarantine can like this comment i just know taylor swift selena gomez gigi hadid and ellie  goulding i have no idea about other celebs vamos falar a verdade essa era pop da taylor e a melhor no film clip will ever have as much power  nothing in the last 5 years has maybe we can agree taylor swift is the music industry starting was like as if its a movie quarantine is making old songs even more popular lets see how many peoples watching this in september 2020 this video makes me question why i wasnt born with legs for days and why im not part of the squad everybodys saying

madagascar movie was inspired by this song ser que tem algum br escutando essa msica em 2020 msc boa demais its 2020 and this song still touches my heart everytime essa musica  divina s eu que sinto uma nostalgia escutando essa msica e estamos aqui 2020 e a muitos anos a frente people coming back to this song in quarantine are legends quem t assistindo em 2020 em plena pandemia  this song will be playing when were all flying up to heaven people who didnt know this before tiktok are disgraces yo creyendo que willyrex es uno de esos elefantes  oh  oh  oh haters will say the elephant is not real los 171k dislikes son gente que les gustan los zoologicos dejen a los animales su libertad alguien que recuerde a willy con esta cancion         i come back to this song every now and then  just to remind myself how beautiful and vibrant this world can be this song is a masterpiece i cant believe that 171 thousand people dont like it im scared of that elephant and i dont know why mi cancion favoria porque representa a willy 3 tiktok doesnt even deserve this song is that kind of music that makes you want to do unbelievable things now lets be honest this song was not in your recommendations you searched for it theyre playing this at the super bowl right now been a while since i listened to this  buscabas un comentario de cuarentena aqu esta like si extraas los viejos tiempos de youtube  though the guy is dancing to the song but inside he is boiled cade os brasileiros representando ouvindo essa nostalgia em 2020 tmj s eu que em pleno 2020 est ouvindo esse hino para relaxar na quarentena september 2018  ser que mientras escucharon la cancin se imaginaron a willy y se cagaron de la risa congratulations find one a coment in english y que no hable de willyrex xdxdxd dear stranger who read this hope you have a beautiful future cant believe that the comment section is still active listening to it now just makes me nostalgic  pov you thought he comment section was going to only be english the most inteligent elephant of the century no one s gonna talk about the beautiful lyrics of the song the message behind it this song is a masterpiece people who actually only know this from tik tok or stupid this song and clover cage  on my mind are the two songs keeping me sane through these tough times i just want to send love to everyone and i want everyone to know things will get better we are in this together et les franais en 2020 vous tes la  boton de likes de los que conocen esta cancion por willy i cant find an english comment that doesnt have someone shoving willyrexs name in it unironically  se han copiado de willyrex c willyrex va a ser padre its better to forget what doesnt convince you that do accept what doesnt please you more it will hurt less without emojis unfortunately  melhor esquecer o que no te convence do que ficar aceitando o que no te agrada mais isso vai doer menos sem emojis infelizmente anyone else feel like crying when hearing this song because it mainly gives you a ton of childhood nostalgia and that its just so beautiful people who know this before the tiktok  take fell for you nuestro willy se nos hace mayor  the people who disliked have no life if you are see this 8 years later in 2020 you are legend  this song reminds me of childhood  when everything was simple  like por willy paradise muri el hijo de willy

from tiktok can like this comment can we just take time and appreciate that tiktok didnt ruin this song i remember when everyone hated this song so much now im starting to think people liked it but didnt wanna admit it lol i dont care who you are but if youre reading this comment i would like to wish you happy new year  plot twist hes bi and would have gladly taken her number too dont worry guys well keep this song a secret between us fun fact the whole world was singing to this 8 years ago this is one of those good old songs that tiktok didnt ruin this brings back childhood vibes  fun fact  youre binge watching nostalgic songs right now if youre listening this in 2020 youre not a legendbut certainly a god the fact that this comment section is still active after 8 years is lit my girlfriend said this song sucked now shes single fact this song is older than most fortnite players the songs you listen to when the boyz arent around i miss 2000s songs and 2010s song people may say there cringe but i loved them i do miss them c for anybody that doesnt know this was when things were so much simpler only people who didnt came from tiktok are worthy of liking this plot twist he called the world failed carly rae jepsen she literally invented male homosexuality in less than 4 minutes i danced to this song in a purple leopard tutu and pretended to sing it when this came out i listened to it on my moms cd player and its some of my fondest memories i dont think a better pop song has come out since this dropped  plot twist at the end the dudes gay 8 years later if youre watching this youre a legend for the kids that werent alive five years ago this was our old town road me watching this when i was 7 close eyes when he pulled off his shirt  the worst that could happen is crushing on a gay guy  okay why was this in my recommendations first the thousand miles song video and now this why does this have 322k dislikes this song is good as this song actually shows how the hottest guys are the gay ones hes not the freedy of icarly this song and clover cage  on my mind are the two songs keeping me sane through these tough times i just want to send love to everyone and i want everyone to know things will get better we are in this together dont worry your not the only one watching this during quarantine wowtruly wonderful voice1 like  50 support me acuardo cuando pona esta cancin a los 10 y ahora se puso de moda  100 hora para poder encontrar la cancin porque no s ingls v whos watching 2020 september i didnt know he was gay i thought he gave him his number cuz i thought they were bros when i saw this at first whos watching this in 2020 btw i love this song sooo much so basically quarantine is just bringing back everyone to legendary songs from their childhood i remember when this song came out i was at the apple store and some white girl started to sing this and literally everyone was starring at her even after 8 years the comment section is active willyrex entro al chat cal mi meibi when this songs out my life was so simple 2018 november  lol in de end  xoxo lets see how many people came this september i love how everybody didnt realize the dude was gay when they were really young i just miss those days when we boys as a kid was scared listening to this because they might think were gay lol ahhhh idk why but i wish i just stayed as a kid carly is more than 30 years old and i think she isnt famous like past why this was a plot twist that shook the pop community and the fact were all watching this rn is insane subscribe to pandagamer27 a girl looked at me once she did not give me her number i cant be the only one here after 8 years  2020 and after watching this a hundred times the plot twist still is unbelievable and shocking for me im here after call me baby  golden times 2012 was hands down one of the best years when i was younger i thought that he gave his number to the guy because he likes the way he plays guitar and want him to play for his party or something im getting nostalgic for music i thought id forever hate my parents told me he was giving him his number cause he wanted to be part of the band  msica bonita da novela destinos cruzados who else is going through an old song session its summer 2012 youre blaring this song through your headphones on youtube in another tab youre playing run on cool math games youre one direction posters hang all over your walls life is good if your watching this 8 years later your a legend the nostalgie of this song is awesom i cant believe this is already considered an old song grande willy va a ser padre i never understand how people can make a vow of commitment and cheat just break up and do whatever you want dont cheat it hurts like hell 6 years later if youre still watching this youre a legend if youre listening to this song in september 2020 youll become a billionaire if youre listening to this song in september 2020 youll become a millionaire lets be honest this wasnt in your recommend you searched it i dont understand this love thing why would anybody stay with someone who just cheated on themthat only makes the suffering worst and is only growing your hate towards your partner if id rather be with someone else it is very clear that i dont want the one im with id rather break up with someone before cheating that is just something that will only hurt them more than a break up if someone cheats on you shehe clearly doesnt love you back and for me that would be enough to just quit trying because everyone deserves better than this sam smith is by far the best emerging artist his music is pure full of soul and has substance dianna agron is the prettiest woman in the world like she is crying so freaking hard but she still looks like a goddess this is so sad my dad cheated on my mom my mom just stayed positive to raise me and my bro unproblematic she just hides it i love her more than my life its really hurt when you have to pretend that youre fine this song is going to be played for the credits when the world ends im crying because the boyfriend that i dont even have is cheating on me drinking in a wedding dress with mascara down her face in a gas station is iconic this beat is still doing it never gets old is that quinn from glee those 149k dislikes are from the people who cheated and this song reminds them there fault who just randomly came to this song in august my girlfriend said this song sucked now shes single imagine getting cheated and forcing yourself to stop loving that specific personmust hurt like hell this is what many of our grandmothers had to go through  thats why their marriages lasted forever leaving was not an option very sad i know im not the only juan i dont know who that girl is but shes as pretty as this song the devil influences everything why dont peoples just eat more vegetables whos listening this in july 2020 everyone time i hear this song  in the car i automatically look out the window and act like im in a sad and depressing movie this song was played on our prom the moment my crush asked me to dance with him we got really close and later became my boyfriend i thought i finally found the right one not until the day i saw him cheating the worst part is with someone im really close with funny to think that this song the reason why we bacame close is now myheartbreak anthem  damn cheaters how is quinn fabrey getting cheated on like come on shes gorgous este es el comentario en espaol del 2020 que buscabas sobre nuestra gran dianna agron 3 rip to everyone who died in 2020 from corona virus  his wife is so freaking hot like goddess status compared to that other chick he was cheating on her with i didnt want to check his phone didnt want to ask him about his day hoped he put his phone on silent put a blind eye to things that id find in his bag i wasnt ready to leave i wanted a little more of him on the final days before i left i hugged him tighter kissed him longer thats all i could do and i left its okay now time heals almost everything to all the cheaters whos listening to this song i hope your partners have the courage to leave you alone to die me watching this noticing that that is quinn from glee  looks like quinn really went downhill after glee club watching dianna agron in a car and praying she doesnt choose to text and drive can not get over how beautiful and classy  this woman is fun fact this corona makes old songs more legendary i pray who ever reads this becomes successful whoever is reading this your skin isnt a paper dont cut it your body isnt a book dont judge it your heart isnt a door dont lock it your life isnt a movie dont end it youre beautiful be you stay safe if youre listening to this song in september 2020 you will become a millionaire no one deserves to relate to this song this song hits you like a grenade when the person you fiercely loved is actually cheating on you lying to your face  looks right in your eyes and says i love you shoutout to my imaginary boyfriend who just recently got married in real life im happy for you though  im in shock because all this time i didnt know that diana agron appears here  was with married for 10 years together for over 12 years we have 3 beautiful kids i cook i clean i take care of our kids i have a good job was able to buy our first house together everything seemed perfect but i always had my doubts there were signs of infidelity but she kept telling me i was crazy and lied about everything just kept piling up the lies for about a year i hated myself for having doubts on the woman ive been with for a third of my life came to the point i found enough evidence and i begged her to tell me the truth she continued to lie but finally confessed being cheated on has been the hardest thing ive ever been through it still hurts and even though i say ive moved on i dont think i will ever be 100 if you want to be with someone else please end your current relationship first cheating is not fun and it definitely isnt fair needless to say i listen to this song everyday and for some odd reason it helps no wonder she didnt make it to brittanas weddings quinn fabray getting a taste of her own medicine the scene where shes crying on the floor with the bottle of alcohol and her makeup running is something i wish i couldnt relate to i felt that in my chest i find it crazy that asap rocky hopped on a remix of the song and made it better i cant stop crying by watching this because this is basically my parents marriage story and still to be continued  i used to bop to this song but then life happened now i cant stop crying just realized im not the only one  i thought i was man enough but damn this pain really hurts after being cheated on this song really hurts i know im not the only juan so he left with a car and walked his ass home im not the only one        wow if i had a wife like her why would i be cheating  no entendi pensei que ela fosse matar o cara no final i just found out that this is dianna agron me seeing that everyones here crying because theyve been cheated or smth sad like that and im just here for dianna agron  get drunk and burn his clothes i dont think so stay sober and pack mine whos still watching in july 2020 be safe everyone imagine cheating on dianna argon couldnt be me i heard dianna agron got cheated and got divorced so sad this mv happened to her my second breakup this year seated on the toilet seat still crying while listening to this song  youve made me realise my deepest fear dianna agron is so pretty cant relate why am i listening to sad breakup songs i havent even had a relationship before how can you even cheat on a wife like her wtf bro youre ill i just dont wanna get married imma scared because everyone cheats the video is perfect shows that a cheater does not care if you are beautiful warm great  they wanna cheat they will i still just spend my time when i watch the video thinking about how stunning dianna is this song can never die even covid cant infect this song its sad to know that diannas boyfriend cheat on her in real life this music video was when i made a vow younger  that id never let anyone try me like a weak bitch i already failed once but never well i ever let anyone try me like that sam smith and adele on one track just imagine that quem a sentiu saudade de algum no qual a msica te relembra o momento e veio aqui para ouvir e chorar venha de like ou t ficando velho 2020 agosto all these years listening to this song and now i feel it nobody deserves this dam time goes by too quick life around this time was the best for me it hurts me when the wife acts sad and crazy bc of what the husband did but when the husband comes home she acts kind and loving like nothing happened  who else started listening to old songs randomly everytime i see diana i remember naya it still hurts i just realized that this was dianna from glee lets be clear sam smith could never had a song more deep and emotional than intoo  even if todiefor hits sooo good no entendo nada mas amo essa msica  dude what the hell you doing your wife is clearly moreee beautiful that the other one this song and clover cage  mirror mirror are two songs keeping me sane during these tough times i just want to send love to everyone and let you guys know that things will get better we are in this together ah yes the days of sam smith and george ezra i didnt know that the lady in this video is quin fabray the most unbelievable part of this music video is that anyone would cheat on dianna agron dear reader you are beautiful and i hope you have an awesome day  so im just realising now that rebecca blacks friday and this song is connected because of the ending only took

it who else still watching it hope yall still enjoying it  who else noticed that some of the glee characters were in here 17 yrs of my life and i didnt notice that rebecca black is here still wondering why she woke up with her normal clothes if youre reading this dont worry youre not the only one rewatching old katy perry songsmusic videos why did i never realize rebecca black is in this and shes the friday friday gotta get down on friday girl coronavirus got us listening to old songs and were like these were the best song this honestly felt like a movie  everyone wants to go back when you didnt know that selena gomez told you that shes farting carrots this song makes me forget about all the bad things in the world this song is older than most of the fortnite players i think everyone wants to go back when katy perry was a legend my girlfriend said this song sucked now shes single when they was playing just dance it brought back so many memories i cant believe katy invented partying on a friday 10 year old me and 18 year old me hear the lyrics differently i had no business knowing this song off by heart at 5 years old lol who else going to the minecraft version after this this is what everyone gonna do after corona virus pandemic this was our childhood cant believe it is 8 years already katy perry made childhoods katy perry is one of the best musicians ever to this day dont doubt me a comeback is in progress are we gonna ignore the fact that the two parents ignored the fact that their daughter was sleeping with the school jock imagine katy perrys daughter doing all of this on a friday night in her teen years i wonder how shell handle it lets be honest when we were little we didnt look away when someone kissed  one day our grandchildren will think that this song is so old this song and clover cage  on my mind are the only two things keeping me sane through these tough times i just want to send love to everyone and i want everyone to know things will get better wtf i still memorize the whole lyrics of this song after so many years the fact that last night katy was wearing different clothes then when she woke up wearing what she wore prior inserts magic gif i think everyone wants to go back when music videos were like a movie who came back to this song in 2020 i just realized darren chris sang this song in glee and is in the music video how did i just find this out its 108 am and im bopping to this damn i went back in time listening to this i wish i could stay the first scene is almost everyones nightmare in highschool your childhood is boring when you didnt listen to this song before i just noticed that this is 8 minutes long man katy perry was a complete hero for bringing rebecca into her video lolz this song was on the top of my head then i searched for it to remember the good ol days i feel like five but the differences is that i want to stay in the past if im being honest the only reason im here rn is so i can hear darren chris say best part ever whoo like he did in glee and also if were being honest we thought we were so cool for knowing all the words to this song and wanting the neon earrings and bodysuits 9 years later and this song still hits different everytime we love that some of the cast of glee is in here when i was around 8 i really thought this mv was the most sexual one out there jokes on me now i cant believe my kids r gonna think this song is so old the song with some english parts that doesnt sound english lol i cant believe   katy is a mom now time   flew so eu que no entendo os comentrios  this is a great parody of dont mine at night wow katy mustve pounded the door so rebbeca could hear bruh darren chris was in this omg  hey um im here from dont mine at night how about you and now shes pregnant it feels like she created this song yesterday crazy how time flies i just figured this song out because of dont mine at night like 7 years ago i just watched the behind the scenes for this and katy perry is playing a 13 year old in this i used to play this everytime with my friend this is so much better than the friday song rebecca black had uploaded is it just me or did anyone else think this was what being a teenager was gonna be like near the end of 2020 and here i am having a breakdown blasting throwbacks 20102014 were good years for me  whose watching this in

invisibility cloak beating up shawn mendes me when my period is coming got a feeling that im going under but i know ill make it out alive just imagine seeing some random 17 year old kid  pretending that he is  getting beaten up and you are thinking what has life become and the plot twist  is it wasent for a music video s brasileiros vo deixa o like i wanna go back to when stitches was just

shawn all he wanted was to get out of parking he was 16 when he made this  unreal i dont think its possible to make him look ugly he was only 17 years old when this came out imagine seeing this poor

in that time shawn mendes had  a habit of hurting himself  we get you bro and thats one of the things that can happen when you park a car whos listening september 2020 now he has camilla cabelo and they are sooo cute together the fact that they put all that effort in breaking the glass and wall only makes the song more emotional i get that effect every time i see the song i just want everything

years we realise how iconic our childhood actually was lets see how many people are watching in september 2020 septiembre 2020 alguien people who didnt come from tiktok can like this 10 years ago this song was ruling the music world nobody with ever come close to this kind of music again the person who likes this will meet lady gaga this song is 10 years old but you can find comments 9 minute ago gaga youre definitely a living legend in youre here on 2020    this song hits differently when youre older unpopular opinion  quarantine makes old songs popular again who here is watching in 2020 wishing that life was as simple as it was back when this video was made after 10 years im still here this song is everything when the homies arent around and you listen to real music the crew of 2020

honesty i feel very lucky to being born and growing up in the same generation as lady gaga celebrating her since 2008 and i can say with all my heart that all the steps of my life felt very accomplished listening to her songs entering college then ending college getting a job entering real adult life with adult life problems and cant even say in enough words how much she helped me through her music i have all the best memories i could wish for it thats why i will always celebrate lady gaga she is more than a pop icon she is and always will be a inspiration to all of us  gaga is a diva its better to forget what doesnt convince you that do accept what doesnt please you more it will hurt less without emojis unfortunately  melhor esquecer o que no te convence do que ficar aceitando o que no te agrada mais isso vai doer menos sem emojis infelizmente the world was not ready for lady gaga wish my kids could find this masterpiece by themselves este es el unico comentario

espaol que escucha esta musica me siento abandonado  si ves esto en 2020 eres una leyenda y ms si hablas espaol lady gaga your songs still in our souls forever this is a song about an insecure girl

iggy does not swear in when people had fun making music videos and didnt make random beef with other singerrappers the nostalgia this song brings back is indescribable 2014 was in fact one of the best years for pop music this century that guys whispering sounds like one of those people that do asmr tingling videos or somethin good old days when sean and ariana were together this song brings back so many undescribable memories the nostalgia is insane this song and clover cage  on my mind are the two songs keeping me sane through these tough times i just want to send love to everyone and i want everyone to know things will get better we are in this together i dont know why but this brings so many memories this was the song that i forced my mom to listen to when i was younger 7 year old me makes a music video in my head while listening to the song the fact that i havent listened to this song in forever and still know iggys part word for word is immaculate its crazy how when this came out everyone was like omg ariana changed so much but now watching this ariana has changed so much since here i spent hours trying to find the name of this song 6 years later if youre still watching this youre a legend she looks like a teenage brat doll so cute  i feel like ariana now only grew up all this time i didnt realize that was big sean like  madison be watching this with notes on i feel like the reason we keep going back to old songs for nostalgia is because this summer feels so empty when ariana hits the whistle tones she sounds so good but when i try it sounds like a dying cat who listening to in september 2020 shes so skinny cara q saudade de 2014 iggy is soooooooo underrated  iggys lipstick is literally cute af  i still remember the entirety of iggys verse all these years later only people who are listening during quarantine can like this comment unpopular question quarantine makes old song popular again whos still watching in september 2020 videos almost 7 years old

girlfriend was determined to sing me this trk var mi millet sesimizi ikartalim bu arkiyi dinleyen tek trk milletinden olan kii olamam                this song hits different after watching the100 even 7years later the boys didnt forget the minecraft best song this is how a pokemon battle feels like its so weird hearing this after 5 years fun factsome of us are hugging teddy bears because we dont want them to fight who remembers when the comment section was not a calendar who else is here because this randomly crossed your mind i dont care what you say this song is gonna make me cry every time everybody gangsta until the bear shoots a laser no soft toys were harmed during making this video wow what a incredible music 0 when they did this on snl it sounded the same rare in wacthing this 5  4 years  its so long i came here again because of the series the 100 superb the releasing date of this song and my birthday date is same 2050 robots filming this my neighbors like this song so much they threw a brick at my window so they could hear it better 8 years later if youre watching this youre a legend anyone see this on a sad song playlist and turn happy because teddys fighting this is it the apocalypse coming up on the next season of life     anyone else always hold their breath from 045 to 054 we didnt realize we were making memories we were having fun this sounds worse than a moose farting in a hallway im sure theres a minecraft parody of this now you dont know how i got that many likes i remember when i was terrified of these stuffed animals im still watching after 8 years the assassins creed cover of this got me goosebumbss lets be honest if this was a movie youd watch it apparently i really wasnt paying attention because i didnt see it was alexandra daddario at 010  im an idiot  pov your watcging this because your in band and your playing this song rip my husband this was his most favorite song and im dedicating this to him may you rest in peace this song and clover cage  on my mind are the two songs keeping me sane through these tough times i just want to send love to everyone and i want everyone to know things will get better we are in this together this remember me the scene in pokemon detectice pikachu when pika pika fights a drugged charizard or that i remember i used to play drums and this was one of the first songs i learned alquem q fala portugues ai 7 years later 1billion views later i still dont understand the video  i can back feeling sad trying to bring back some memories when i didnt know much im 13 i probably know nothing and im already back here for when it was just easier 7 years had passed but i still dont understand why would people dislike this muppets the movie rated r 2020 still goes hard as fck good song for these new normals in our lives nowcorona virus and the rioting in most cities fun fact while i was watching this video i had a car crash ahaha memories 1 something billion views i grew up with this song dont say whos here in 2020 because we never left this band imagine dragons song radioactive there just to cute im going to die of to much cutens wow i had heard this song on the radio never knowing it was from imagine dragons        httpsyoutube2dl6sx5xbka i cant believe this song came out almost 8 years ago who just randomly came to this song in september 2020 my girlfriend said this song sucked now shes single i dont care if drake did that only for the video but he brought smile on people faces and it was heart touching i love it wish all the  famous people would do that around the world life was so different when this came out god bless everyone better days are coming probably the best mil he ever spent respect  dont ask whos here in 2020 because we never left the random person who likes this will become a billionaire one day its great to see him giving back like that respect the random person that likes this will become a millionaire one day guaranteed 1 year later is he still gonna run for president cause id vote drake abenoado por deus todo respeito a este artista humilde e bom de corao   respect to drake 691 million vue   who just randomly came to this song in september 2020 this song was made 3 years ago look how many people still listen to the song cada like um br que quer conhecer o drake i love drake youre a great person  its 2020 now is homeboy gon run for president lol only people that didnt come from tiktok are worthy of liking this comment only future billionaires can like this comment this video is beautiful never say whos here in lockdown because we never loved this song we love this song i pray who ever reads this becomes successful this video motivated me so much thanks drake  this aint a song its looking at how generous drake is latecommentgang vamo pensar com calma se ningum esteve se gravando vocs fariam a mesma coisa que ele fez sem inteno de viws ou coisa do tipo all the dislikes are people who were at the store an hour before drake came just realize that guy walking with drake in the mall is antonio brown just imagine how many people visit here everyday 1 minute of silence for the kids who skipped school that day lol drake makes 1m per every concert he performs  its good hes donating and he should be praised so more celebs do this kinda stuff but sum these commentators talking like hes a god im still waiting to see that guy announce his run for president here before 1 billion views 314 is my favorite part who just randomly came to this song in september 2020 this song and clover cage  on my mind are the two songs keeping me sane through these tough times i just want to send love to everyone and i want everyone to know things will get better we are in this together what an amazing guy when he says its a good life i felt that its 2020  and the drunk guy at the start still not president of united states  smh he really is a blessing for all these people and more to come who is coming this artist listen for after sidhu who is here on 2020 issa hit 317 that guy is getting tortured like this commet 509 honestly if this guy ran for president he would probably win this made my love for drake even stronger ughhhh 141  they will take whatever comes at them  i have seen dpgs tossing away war of which such a large crowd does nothing that had it been responded to in the same coin would have not been half the story but they stall  do not take too long  take the whole time  the diference between a dog and snake talking is when 1 starts never stops  no pause  no inbetween  no nothing  it is just bark  no inner capacity to realize and snakes is more like they only interrupt  do not have much to say or always the same but when some1 says anything they just topple over on the same moment  they have no build up  from it is the only way to uproot game  they speak of patience for when stealthing around but it is much about the on going action instead where comprehension is formulated like the 1st video  1 understands the situation  probably the last thing they do  it is neither and defence too aids on nothing  it is only preventive  1 makes whatever was those timestamps that still may not always be at 1  s favour  as such is seen in wrestling talking of build ups or lost title matches according to falls and then is actually who comes back for another match  fully depleted is kind of op  it only brings both ends closer to each other  most do die or did by the sword within it where such a clatter is catched and not kept up with  not nessecarly any deadly blow or defended from at 1st  who is watching this in 2020 wow drake big big heart hey future people im from the corona times drake fans like here cant believe this was filmed in a society i was in middle school listening to this  now that im older i actually know the meaning of this song respect to drake what would i do without him this is the best music video of 2018 right now who here is watching in 2020 wishing that life was as simple as it was back when this video was made imagine being the one kid who drake came up and talked to o hi sorry for bad english mr beast  we remember you for doing this everyday whens that guy running for president it was gods plan this song was called gods plan i came here because i was just listening to in my feelings i was like what other song have i not listened to in a while that used to bang who just randomly felt like listening to this song how can there be about 450000 dislikes literally the 1 people whos reading i strongly hope your parents live longer than 101 years with awesome health  the best video you could ve ever done with a million dollars incredible drake made everything back with this song how i feel about helping my teachers carry they stuff to school before class start  k i n g  who els was like how does this not have a billion likes when i give back to my community itll be inspired by drake cause its gods plan  i cant believe some people disliked this video i wish that one day i can make impact like that who just randomly came to this song in september 2020 r e s p e c t  most of the stuff drake does mr beast did collaboration or copying or what kim kardashian kanye west welcome to your tape ok but lets be honest this was the comeback of the century dear stranger who ever likes this comment  may your mother live for 100 more years taylor just roasting different versions of herself at the end is just pure comedy all who disliked obviously their names are in red underlined im sorry the old taylor cant come to the phone right now  she is out walking her pet leopard its funny how everyone hated on this song when it was released now everyone realizes what an iconic comeback it was i remember how shocked the internet was when this was first released this iconic artist doesnt deserve 12 m dislikes this song just sounds better now that the truth is out i dont think this song will ever get old ok but lets be honest this was the comeback of the century when taylor release this song a lot of people were talking like i miss old taylor the truth is out this song aged like fine wine even if you hate her you still love her thats just how great she is this song is specifically dedicated to kim kardashian and kanye west rats of the century stop saying whos here in 2020 we never stop listening to this masterpiece song you know 1 bilion is coming im sorry the old taylor cant come to the phone rn why oh cause were in quarantine this song is so much better after she got her side cleared this iconic performer doesnt deserve a million dislikes whos here after the full phone call got leaked she was telling the truth and im happy i believed in her you dont even have to be taylor swift fan to admit this song makes you feel like a legend unpopular opinion quarantine makes old songs popular again how did kanye and kim ever survive taylor swifts music is almost everywhere d taylor is not the artist of the decade she is the artist of the century people say taylor swift has only american fans  like if you arent american lol the zombie taylor looks like me when i enter school  guys almost 10milion likes lets make this happen this has been the most iconic come back periodt now i realize how authentic that whole reputation album was for people like me who dont keep up wfamous peoples lives at all i assumed she was changing her music style to keep up w trying to be cool like most pop artist do i did still enjoy the album but i had no knowledge of anything pertaining to taylor since 2015 so i didnt relate to where she was coming from now w some context i realize how brilliant this album is 3 years later if youre still watching this youre a legend in the robbery scene it was like harley quinn and her squad here before 1 billion jesus christ is coming soon repent whos here after the whole phone call was leaked exposing kim and kanye as the liars  taylor was telling the truth this whole time makes this video even better the way this music video costs 10 million dollars to make because she literally cut off the wings of a private jet taylor swift  look what you made me do kanye west diss  this was a cultural reset she bit back by mocking the insults thrown at her and turning so many mean references eg snakes playing the victim on their heads remember when everyone hated this song now its an iconic throwback whos here after the full phone call got leaked she was telling the truth and im happy i believed in her 13 million dislikes are from all the rats living under kanyes house the whole video is just taylor being a badass me takes my sisters phone me drops it sis why in the damn world would you do that me  look what you made me do for stealing my cookies  lets admit dark taylor is sooo badass the only useful thing kim and kanye did was motivate taylor to make this masterpiece the best part of the video is taylor roasting herself at the end of the video its funny how all the haters dislike this song and taylor swift but still come and watch her videos lmaooo getting receipts gonna edit this later its sad that some people are just now supporting taylor she never lied and it was so obvious especially cause kim edited the video way too much to look bad for taylor but you know what karma has finally happened whos here after watching the reputation concert on netflix i dont care what they say but this is the comeback of the century but why 1 million dislikes cant believe this was over three years ago as taylor said haters gonna hate yep im watching dis in 2020 taylor its gonna be crazy uwu trkler nerdesiniz gren her trk beensinde saymz bilelim i dont believe this was made 2 years ago if taylor attended the grammys during reputation imagine how her dress would look like  a comeback like this will be the most iconic things ever to shock me in my whole life its weird how most of us living on earth will never meet or even acknowledge each others existence for example if youre reading my comment this is probably the first and last time youll ever see me 101 noticed when she missed the cup of tea lol 3 years ago damn time flies by so fast feels like this was released last year its already 2020 but i still cant get over this music video so the truth was always in front of us taylor always was a victim of this history today the video from kanye west playing the liar one leaked and finally taylor are free from this situation this is why we cant have nice things she just did what everyone told her that shes gonna become this song still holds the record for 400m views in just 21 days best taylor era periodt i remember when this bop came out i was shooked and i was listening to this everyday literally everyday she told the truth she showed the truth and after nobody believed in her the truth finally show us who was saying what really happened i lived for this moment sou o unico brasileiro que gosta das msicas this song and clover cage  on my mind are the only two things keeping me sane through these tough times i just want to send love to everyone and i want everyone to know things will get better that scene with the car still appalls me to this day 9 yrold me getting scared in the first scene where taylor was alive 13m dislikes to be honest i would jam to this song cause this song would hype me and my friends up i understand people would want taylor to become the old taylor but her choice is her choice if she wants to evolve she can smh this music is still so iconic how many indian fans for taylor  99m likes iconicccc i remember how shocked the internet was when this was first released taylor swift to trashcanye karma is real i like ill be the actress starring at your bad dreams how are there 1 million dislikes on this masterpiece like even people who hate taylor have said they cant hate this video anyone obsessed with the snakes like i am lwymmd still hold the record for fastest video to reached 300m views in just

without salt quando me lembro 7x1 eu venho aqui chorar est cancin me da nostalgia me trae tan lindos recuerdos  i find it hilarious that kurt being a janitor drop out became one of the most successful singers ever making a song about his later school years only to find out that song means nothing and all the words are jumbles of nothingness the fact that this comment section is still active after 11 years is lit my wife said she hates nirvana  me   see you in divorce court happy birthday kurt would have been 47 i guess the fact that even tho this song is 11 years old people are still listening to this rad song i respect all you are all legends este es el comentario en espaol que tanto buscaste            smells like quaranteen spirit imagine freddie mercury kurt cobain and chester bennington doing a show in the heaven wow i love how after 11 years the comment section is still alive lmao i feel sad for those people who think that they have great taste in music and still havent heard this song yeah this song cant be old i give you the 90s national anthem the song that never sucks when you hear it you just wish to turn the volume up am i the only 15 year old who listens to good music starter pack chinese man after eating a bat i feel stupid its funny that only pepole who dislike the song are diehard nirvana fans just imagine if courtney hadnt killed kurt 1 billion for a guy that died before youtube existed this song makes me want to knock out matt from wii sports in boxing this song gives me the feeling of when you are an introvert and you are extroverted for one day and you have an unfathomable amount of energy and you dont know what to do with it i feel stupid and contagious the us under the covid crisis i dont always listen to nirvana but when i do the neighbors do too imagine how much people come here every day            is it me or does kurt look like shaggy from scoobydoo kurz cobain chester bennington avicii freddy mercury janis joplin amy winehouse  and so much more singers who were gone 2 early from this world it is very sad i hope they all make a big concert in heaven 1 billion and 100 million views this is history people youre watching and listening to history its amazing back when lyrics werent really a thing when this was released and i wonder what people thought he was saying 11b views amazing also i disagree that this song is overrated i wasnt even here when they released it  000 the most legendary shoe in rock history im so proud to be named river cobain for real not joking if kurt only knew his success this song makes me party hard but suicide at the same time nirvana says goodbye to 2019 with a billion views its crazy how we are listening to these songs again as a different people people who are reading this you have the best taste in music fun and not so fun fact kurt cobain was arrested for spray painting god is gay       chinese guy who ate the bat i feel stupid and contagious hard to think every person in this high school inspired video are middle age persons with simple lifes now me and the class when the teacher gone be like this song and clover cage  on my mind are the two songs keeping me sane through these tough times i just want to send love to everyone and i want everyone to know things will get better we are in this together fun fact we dont care which year you saw this video 1 like is an another show of nirvana with kurt  imagine if kurt freddie  chester are rocking in heaven                1 billion views gotta say everytime i hear this im blasted back to being a teemager throwing myself around my bedroom kurt you are missed dont ask whos here in 2020because we never left vous tes la les rockeurs franais whos here after logan reacts charley and friends the movie i see everyone respects him  rip cobain dave back there pounding those drums pound those drums dave back in 91 nirvanas nevermind was flying off the shelves faster than toilet paper during this coronavirus outbreak wow song really is cool i played this on full volume and my neighbors threw a brick thru the window just to hear it better the 1st minute of this is quite arguably the coolest thing ive ever seenheard if you guys are wondering why theres so many comments in french its because theres a channel called cocovoit and they recently made a video about nirvana kinda like a skit here we are now in containers avacado a potato misheard lyrics  36           there is only one song that never gets old ill never get enough of this song everione who is listening that in 2020 has a good taste of musik my father maid me license to this to this when i was young i didnt like it then know i kinda love it the only thing thats still good in 2020 i am 15 years old and i love this type of music someone else my age i was watching the batman trailer and this was recommended to me    11     im just listening cos of the fundraiser honestly a song that never ages more powerful today vs yesterday gosto muito do black metal mais o nirvana tambm  diferenciado damn how could so many people still be listening in 2020 kurt is the goat this song came out when i was in 7th grade glad to witness such a historic period in music this song made history in all sorts of ways killed hairbands as we knew back in the 80s period my neighbors listen to this every day its not like they have a choice one billion views  celebrate with us by checking out the aha capsule collection httplnktotakeonme1billion  for joel if you ever feel dumb remember that people actually disliked this video this song will never age doesnt matter when you read thiseverytime i see this video i comment p the pencil artist hands must have been a cartton after this she shouldnt date him he looks kinda sketchy my girlfriend said this song sucked now shes single my mother said this song suckednow im homeless when this song is giving you nostalgia but youre a 2000s kid 80s guys are more attractive and im tired of pretending theyre not dont tell all the kids who like the weeknds blinding lights where he got it from his vocal range is higher than the drugs the woman is on best music video ever made aqui  brasil te amoooo my mother said this song suckednow im homeless can we have a moment of silence for the kids who think this song is 10 years old if never gonna give you up didnt exist i comment because in 10 years someone will read it and think wow thats 10 years ago my girl friend didnt like this song now she is my ex the fact that this comment section is still alive proves how legendary this song is only reason why im watchin this is cause my dad and hes like 80s vibes and im like was i born still the greatest music video ever made if never gonna give you up didnt exist this doesnt get old you know this whole thing looks sketchy i dont trust anybody here xd this is true music not like the new shty songs             boy is this nostalgic it makes me think of a time when corona didnt exist still good in 2018  only people who heard this in vine can like this 80s fans theres an awesome 80s inspired band today called fire tiger the fact that this has over 1 billion views is just crazy but makes sense setembro 2020 tem brasileiros  aii tmj i was a poor lost brother wandering the world until i clicked this song i actually searched for this song so shut up one of the top 10 most creative artistic music videos of all time  my brother says that only boomers like this prove me wrong they should have broken up their relationship seems drawn out this song is so good i was not born then but i wish i was and its so good and im only 9 only 1980s kids smash like button my neighbour phoned the police because i was playing this too loud the police arrested my neighbour tem musicas q eu vou escutar pra sempre uma msica icnica dessa e o povo vim pelo tiktok            all the promises at sundown i meant them like the rest this comment is the only thing youll ever know about me this comment is the first and last time well cross paths in life you probably wont see me other comment sections or anywhere else in general so i would just like to say good luck and have fun the worlds the limit an no one can stop you from what you love no matter what you do in life the worst case is you try your best you be yourself and do what you can do with compassion honesty effort and understanding and it goes worst case and then you move on like everything else can we just take a minute to appreciate the vocal range like how does anyone else feel like this has two iconic beats i can only wonder how impressed and shocked people back then would have been after seeing the amazing effects in music videos like this and money for nothing millions of likes billions of views no idea how many hundreds of thousands of those are mine this song and clover cage  on my mind are the only two things keeping me sane through these tough times i just want to send love to everyone and i want everyone to know things will get better when i first saw this i thought ah yeah the best band ive ever seen playing morten harkets voice will always be eternal the 80s were and always will be thought of as a legendary time for music 051 i just love this part where the camera guy just pans over the drawlings face and her face and then his beady eyes and then hers its truly art you know its mad how the comment section is still active after 10 years join the before 1 billion and 150 mil squad here this comment is the only thing youll ever know about me this comment is the first and last time well cross paths in life you probably wont see me other comment sections or anywhere else in general so i would just like to say good luck and have fun the worlds the limit an no one can stop you from what you love no matter what you do in life the worst case is you try your best you be yourself and do what you can do with compassion honesty effort and understanding and it goes worst case and then you move on like everything else este ao 2920 vena a ha achile nos cago el corona virus tendremos que esperar 2021 agosto ser los espero  damn the editing and the drawing for 80s song is legendary who else started listening to old songs randomly jokes aside the guy who drew this is pretty talented 36 years later and the song ribaliza with what sounds in 2020 10 years later you are here enjoying this song great way to start off the day is listening to this song for the people who simp for fictional characters know the pain this song was playing in background while my sister was dying 80s playing this on the jukebox in the caff at the leisure centre after swimming with my friends i prefer 197090s song than modern songs my favorite anime this is where they drew the line the only 80s song i still get excited to hear when it comes on if you didnt search for this song then the song searched for you this is without doubtthe best song ever who remembers that one meme with the girl if you know u know putting the tip of the small finger on ones corner lips and saying one billion views ill have one of whatever that girl had props to the people who worked on this timeless music video found out the illustrators name is mike patterson my eyes filled with tears during the silent moment at the end and i have no idea why i love this people should understand that not every man and woman existing in one environment means they have a sexual connection this is to me a child with a addict parent lots of emotions pulling and pushing she towards the end analyzes her father she realizes she can get out and tries to take him with her barley holding on to him only hes not coming with her hes stuck in his ways and is desperate for his child and his child is desperate for her father but the two are separated by the cage that is addiction shia labeouf is an amazing actor this is art not pedophilia if you see something sexual in this you should probably get therapy this video may look wrong for few people 5 years later if youre still watching this youre a legend this video is a masterpiece and it doesnt look pedophile at all the acting and the dance is just so good with meaning of the song is just amazing overall did anyone cry when the dad couldnt leave the cage or just me shias acting is just insane whether its in movies or music videos hes an amazing actor woah what a video oo my interpretation was a child being able to escape the mindset that their parent was locked inside and not being able to help them out of it  fascinating how many different directions people can take it this song and clover cage  warcry are two songs keeping me sane through these tough times i just want to send love to everyone and i want everyone to know things will get better anyone that found this sexual has never been to an acting conservatory the video is not the problem people who see something sexual in it are in what a horrible world we live every relationship of an adult man with a young girl must be associated with pedophile undertones so should i forbid my husband to have any contact with the nieces this song is about sia and her dad sia escaped this disease that she had but her dad did not maddie is playing the role as sia and shia plays as the dad this is not pedophila people know this was rehearsed and practiced right they arent alone lol theres a crew make up crew camera crew the director the actors the singer theres probably like 50 plus people there all together dont worry folks everyone in this video is safe and everyone knows exactly what is going on and what they are doing so yeah dont worry about them they are fine how she smells his hands hes her mental demon but at least his scent is familiar beautiful video relating to mental health  ok so if you think this video is in any way sexual the problem is in you not the video just for some people who find this wrong its art not pedophilia i cant believe sia had to apologize for this this is a masterpiece people are idiots shia is a genius he innovates many levels than regular humans for all who are still thinking this is sexual get professional help and heal your sexually obsessed minds the ending where shes trying to pull her dad out from the cage of mental illness damn always hits me its so real the video and amazingly performed artshould comfort the disturbed and disturb the comfortable god not every grown up and child combo means pedophilia the fact that people see this and their mind jumps to something sexual above all else is very telling about them the cage symbolizes the internet and its saying there are predators out there and little girls shouldnt be on the web misleading these predators    can we appreciate how much of a flexible actor shia is slay me mk so now that weve educated the people who thought this was sexual can we now focus on how amazing this song is should just call optimus prime to destroy that cage ez i loved this anybody else watching this in 2020 so people dont sexualize twerking but sexualize a music video representing a daughter trying to escape her fathers alcoholism  this song and clover cage  on my mind are the only two things keeping me sane through these tough times i just want to send love to everyone and i want everyone to know things will get better me and my father are both bipolar i got help after nearly dying he has never seen a doctor this feels so right on i watched this again after many years of hardship and it is a beautiful representation i cry every time i have been listening to this song for three days now and im not tired of it yet anyone else watching this in 2020 coronavirus lock down  life was so different when this came out i wish that one day sia listens to my music and we make a hit song together god bless everyone better days are coming this is high art some simple mind people just dont get it this song if understood properly should bring fathers to tears the absolute best part in this for me was 342 when maddie starts bonking shia on the forehead because everytime she does a different expression shows from shia as if symbolizing how sias dad had a goofy side a mean side a sympathetic side etc this part stuck out to me alot and i dont see anyone else ever mention it its beautiful every time i watch i find my self crying at the end how tf do yall sexualize this masterpiece its so emotional and heartbreaking its art this song and clover cage  on my mind are the two songs keeping me sane through these tough times i just want to send love to everyone and i want everyone to know things will get better we are in this together imagine being as talented as the 2 people in the video what incredible is when the siblings feel responsible for his parents mistakes that themselves who else is randomly watching this in 2020 during quarantine all the people commenting on here that its just art acting or depicting the dynamics of a fatherdaughter relationshipyou people need a good dose of lead therapy shia is a master of performance this moves me just as much in 2020 as it did in 2015 fantastic for the ofended people  your thinking on this video reflects when the psychiatrist ask you what do see in this picture then the doctor can tell what the heck your brain full of they are professionals  manys young dancers dance with older men only sick minds think its something else when i first watched this i cried at the ending but now that i know the meaning i cried through the whole thing stop asking whos still listening in 2020 we never stopped listening when i see this i see it as a story of being a girl and being trapped in a really toxic environment as she matures she realizes she doesnt have to continue that cycle of thinking and in turn is able to escape that cage when she reenters that cage its because she wants to show perhaps her father whom she grew up with poor maddie is with a bigger man no i hate ittt nothing is dirty here people are just dirty minded and misunderstood the message in this scene p i know little of contemporary dance i do know that focusing on the dance the movements themselves are the goal if you can forget the difference in age or the fact one was male and one female dismiss that they are even human the dance mimics animal behavior i saw one being  shia longing for connection   shia labeouf        if only she could get him out of the cage i cant believe sia had to apologise for this masterpiece stop sexulising it its about sia trying to excape her disorder all the people that said it was bad has dirty minds whos watching in april 2018 if you can dance like this youre on a whole nother level but if you cant youre not alone dear stranger whoever reads this may you and  your parents live over 100 years  not even do caged animals act like this girl this song and clover cage  on my mind are the two songs keeping me sane through these tough times i just want to send love to everyone and i want everyone to know things will get better we are in this together sia is the queen  ahhhhhhhhhhh i just love this 3 this song reminds me of my dad and i always end up tearing up i always thought of this video as a single dad raising his daughter and all the struggles that a parent has to go through to raise a child on their own and then in the end the child grows up and moves on with their life sia out of the cage but somehow we still miss our parents and wish we could be with them sia trying to pull shia out of the cage but we know that it will never be that away again plz tell me thats not really shia labeouf with all this weird hollywood stuff going on i hope the people find this weird to it literally took me all these years to understand the video and now i do and i did cry i was married to an alcoholic for 10 years  i loved him and hated him at the same time  i still love him  and finally i had to get out of that cage  he wouldnt  this video i felt this for ten years 5 years later and this song still reminds me of me and my brothers toxic relationship sia worst music with the best videos i like the fact that her names sia but i still cant sia beautiful shia climbed that cage like it was nothing insane completely ignoring the meaning of the song and imagery and their dance i love the absolute control that shia had regarding maddie like there wasnt a moment where i felt like shia wasnt being absolutely careful with how much strength he put into interacting with maddie or felt like he would hurt her that man knows his strength and how far to go and maddie trusts him to know that limit i really like that my love of my life passed away due to the fight with mental illness i watch this video often and understand better the fight she had this was a favorite video of hers sometimes with her illness she felt trapped in a young body this song and video brings tears and remembrance each time this whole song is about sia and her abusive father the video makes perfect sense just  no one understands  if people werent so sick minded and stopped sexualising everything theyd see the absolute beauty in this video i cant believe sia had so much criticism from this its a true work of art and it shook me to my core finally shes tamed she loves but hes trapped and she cant save him idc about the sick coments this still one of my fav music videos he thinks she needs him but in the end finds he needs her it reminds me of intimacy kind of like a traumatized animal that you adopt both parties want to be close to the other but they are both scared and inevitably inadvertently trigger one another each time they attempt to get close it is a struggle a back and fourth but in the end it seems she feels safe with him she shows him the way out and they both want him to come with her  but he cant escape his own prison beautiful absolutely amazing from siavevo maddie ziegler and shia labeouf the whole video was extraordinary representing emotional pain from both of them and then at 420s that had to be the saddest heart felt hit ive ever experienced in a music video a daughter trying to save her father from whatever the anguish and escape needed is shown in shia lebeouf characters facial expression wow youre just a weirdo if you thought this video wax wrong n weird  ningum fala de pedofilia ou abuso sobre o programa dance moms onde a professora deu um selinho na maddie pra mostrar a ela como se beija the fact that people associate this with pedophilia or sexuality in general shows how twisted the internet has become how can you even look at this an think of something sexual i feel like something might be wrong with you if you can look at this and see anything sexual about it people can share an intimate relationship without it being sexual in this case it is the intimacy between father and daughter dude shia labeouf is in this and my mind is blown dear whoever is reading this we dont know each other but i wish nothing but best and happiness for you and your family its a pretty grim tell of our modern world where the relationship between a father and daughter is just automatically interpretted as devious this is the same society where men are faced with criminal action for helping a lost child who asks for help one of the best music videos ever i listened to this song again during quarantine this nostalgia brings calm best hit of 2019 consolation bfor 2020terrible still love this artist collab such a good song yeah but why arent they wearing helmets a year but the song same soo good like if youre here in 2020 anyone else here who is totally addicted of this song like me  the whole comment section is filled with shawn  camillas were just friends joke i dont think this song is about them being friends is it me or the lyrics of the song is just laa laa laa laa x 100       warning  this song is ohhhhlalaladdictive listen at your own risk dont worry your not the only one listening this masterpiece in 2020 imagine how many people come every day here and listen this song helmets people helmets aaaargh thats just dumb riding without one just like here if you are here everyday or more than one time plzzz dont ask

escutando essa pedrada cade os br  this is the real dance monkey and its one million times better than the other song it has a feeling of morning joy freedom and leisure finally and that everything can be alright 4 years laterif youre  still watching thisyoure a legend  4 years later if youre still watching this youre a legend this is the original dance monkey i feel my soul here see to the sky and singing this part of myselfmy english is bad sorry david attenborough watching this be like   this is actually a deleted scene from rise of the planet of the apes me at 0000 am band coldplay song adventure  of a lifetime lets be honest guys it wasnt in our recommended we search for it yeah shes naked but she never actually showed anything she must have really wanted people to forget hannah montana didnt understand this 5 years ago now it sucks to say i can relate looking back this is not at all scandalous just tragic she was so broken and back then we paid attention to the fact that she was naked when now all i see is the pain in her eyes okay but like i still dont understand why she was licking that nasty hammer someone here after midnight sky you could tell the pain she was going through and we all made fun of her  i still can remember how shocked the media was when this came out honestly miley was ahead of her time she was naked to show weakness and purity it was art not sexualization but yall are to focused on sexualizing the female body that her career fell because of how disgusting society was during this time if you still find nudity revolting and sexual then shame on you being nude used to be art and beauty purity and weakness the same people who are like ew everythings so sexual and gross now theres so much skin being shown are the same people who are like i wish it were like the old days where no one showed skin but news flash back then there was more nudity than ever it sucks that people were so mad her body is human and natural if you see it as sexual thats on you i remember how close minded people were back in the day theres  11m comments if you find mine then you are a legend i came here for atypical she isnt naked because she still has her boots on kinda sad to see miley try so hard to tell everybody that she isnt hannah anymore i wish youtube could filter old comments just to see what people thought about this when it was released lets be honest this song was our childhood and we didnt realize it my mom always told me not to watch this but look at me now im a lesbian whos just here because they randomly thought about this song lets be honest life was good when this song came out she deserves a grammy for this song not gonna lie her hair looks like justin biebers this song didnt deserve the hate it got when it first came out guys shes not naked shes wearing shoes life is too short to pretend you dont like this song obviously she is hurt but no one kinda noticed that because of the actual music video and neither did i honestly this song isnt even sexual when you compare it to wap to whoever called this inappropriate dont watch wap the dislikes are the people who tried to ride the ball and sings but they fell bc the ball broke bc of their voice tbf the nudity was shocking but i think it was mostly because mileys image was really innocentdisney girl at the time so it was insane to see her like this 7 years later if youre watching this youre a legend 1 million comments like if you can find mine if donald trump builds the wall you know who to call she was licking that hammer  depicts she was liking a hammer who break her values  her morals when that hammer please her to break her own values that break her soul you break me this vedio is deep whos here after midnight sky remembering how shocked the world was about this after wap is out n the world is obsessed well licking the hammer is one way to get coronavirus cant believe this was almost 10 years ago when this came out everyone was shocked but here we are with the wap lol do you remember that time when nudity was shocking us whos watching this after her 2020 vmas performance lets see how many people are watching in september 2020 i dont know why people disliked this so much this song is good why all the comments say 2018 its great how miley was so openminded at that time she was ahead of most of the peopleshe didnt deserve the hate people gave to her and the song when it came out this doesnt even bother me now or anyone now people are like how iconic i dont get why people hated her for this video when she didnt even show anything mileys best song cant deny that even if you dont like her why did this song get so much hate im not complaining shes got the perfect body this song would have been more respected if she wasnt naked and making out with equipment it would have also been ignored a moment of silence for the parents looking through their kids search history the dislikers are people without a gfbf xd dont ask whos here in 2020 because lets be real we never left she is a strong womanperiodt man this has nothing on wap i remember when everyone was calling this too sexual and way too much for youtube i really feel stupid how close minded i was my god pov you are here after listening to wap people slutshamed her for this and that was only a few years ago the world is changing so fast when this came out people focused on her showing skin rather than the reason she used the imagery she used this is art the lyrics are art love for miley always  does anyone else watch this and wonder why we wondered why shes naked now we watch this and its fine on disney channel is hannah montana so i was thinking about this song miley yes lets lick a hammer and make out with a chain who is here from watching the wap video and now this isnt that bad i will always want you we all say that when were in love with someone but when that someone is not the indicated one its painful say that sentence  lol i didnt know that it was cyrus song how many years have passed and she is still beautiful and graceful just imagine how many peoples come here everyday when people saw this when it came out they were shocked now its just a normal music video honest statementwhen it was released it was one of the most viewed song whos here after miley swung on a disco ball at the vmas 4000 people are just not happy thumbs up for such a phenomenal song i remember when the comment section was normal not a calendar everyone when covid 19 ends this feels good this was the ultimate feel good song back in the day i cant imagine

lost this song was inspired by the death of young protestant childen in britain who were murdered during the northern ireland troubles although dolores was catholic irish she made this song in opposition to political aggression whether its the irish republican forces or the british unionist forces the point is there is only right and wrong good and bad both of which knows no sides as an irish man i pray that one day we all understand this message of unity not as an island but as compassionate human beings for one another  instead of the narcissistic exploitation of compassionate

the camera instead not only from tiktok  we came from pes  pro evolution soccer brasil algum whos listening to this while were still in quarantine just came from listening to a few other old 2011 bangers my self said this song is sucked now iam dead 2020 the worst year ever wish everything can just be simple again i love this song  like if you like a lot xd damn this is so nostolgic even though its only been 6 years not meny people  in this group for 21 pilots alguien  que hable espaol y escuche a twenty one pilots five years later and im still wondering what he plugged his keyboard

whole family  someone will find this comment one day this song is 4 years old holy hell this is do nostalgic this comment is the only thing youll ever know about me this comment is the first and last time well ever cross paths in life you probably wont see me in other comment sections or anywhere else in general so i would just like to say good luck and have fun the worlds the limit and no one can stop you from doing what you love no matter what you do in life the worst case is you try your best you be yourself and you do what you can do with compassion honesty effort and understanding and it goes worst case and then you move on like everything else anyone else heard this song in their head and searched once i was 7 years old  i dont care who you are this song is a piece of history i changed my comment so you cant understand responses and why i got so many likes sometimes we wish we had done the things we couldve done this wasnt recommended to you you searched this up i was just chilling in bed and this song just came across my brain for some reason i decided to listen to it its been a long time since i heard this song and as soon as i pressed play so many memories just went through my head this song made me think about how i am growing up and watching my family grow up listing to the start of the song just made me remember all the times i spent with my family and just remembering how much i loved them i just wanted to comment on this real quick no special reason i just felt like i had to when tihs song 7 years old i will come back again 1 people who are reading this may god bless you whos here at 1 billion views god i miss my childhood just imagine who is here everyday anyone here in 2020 wishing good music like this was still alive nostalgia is the best and the cruelest feeling i randomly thought of this and im back the nostalgia is insane and it makes me sad they said time flies at i didnt believe them but wow did it fly  i dont even know how many times ive listened this song only people who didnt came from tiktok are worthy of liking this once it was 2019 i was move freely its corona time if you see this i just want to say why are people making songs like wap instead of this life was so different when this came out god bless everyone better days are coming we spent our whole childhood wanting to grow up and we will spend our whole adulthood wishing we were kids again if youre here in 2020 you are a true legend who is here after failing in life and remembering childhood  when the people who gives you good memories dissapears this memories

till this is 7 years old this song explains my past current and future years when i die this is the song that plays in the credits moral of the song life moves faster than we expected but it teaches you to live it to the fullest ive watched this more than 20 times bc its a true masterpiece 1 if you hear this after 2 in the evening trying to find something that express you people who dislikes are they pass their life easily and didnt have future at the start of this year i commented that this song deserves way more viewsnow its a good 1b views the saddest part about life is when the person that gives you memories become memories why the hell does youtube automatically makes me dislike when i like and go all i can thinks of is a quote wake up to reality nothing ever goes to planned in this accursed world the longer you live the more you realize only pain suffering and futility exist madara uchiha life is so fast i still remember the first day of school now im grade 5 i think its crazy it seems like yesterday i went to grade 3 i know when i grow up i will regret that i didnt spend time with my parents because of technology i always try to spend time with them but i never really think of what will happen in my after life this song and clover cage  on my mind are the only two things keeping me sane through these tough times i just want to send love to everyone and i want everyone to know things will get better times were simple back when this was published i miss it allways crying of nostalgia when hearing this song  sorry we ran out of tickets this is a great song because people still put comments even seconds ago thats how good it is i will listen to this song at every age he mentions every time it hits harder anyone hear the bicycle in the back round or

around the world as some1 who is not from the western world i can tell u 4 a fact of his impact as a megastar  rarely do we copy a specific style of an artist from that world but we have done it for other icons like james  brown mj  john travolta grease look and it says so much abt chris and his impact as an artist around the world not 2 mention his murals and quotes from his songs plastered along walls but i still cant believe that in this day and age some1 can have an effect like that with social media and everything nato children when i tell u chris made people in  the rest of the world dress up like him he did his thing its like they say imitation is a huge form of flattery  cb has millions of ppl that impersonate his fashion stylemusic dancing stylez acrobatics  when this video came out it became a unisex look and they copied him from the hat  to the leather jacket with white tshirt to the black jeans with a colorful shirt tied around their  waist and down to the timberland shoes like it was  still is a fashion look what is crazy  is that its when u see artist like brown that makes u realize and takes u aback that these artists really can affect the day 2 day lives of ppl around  the world congrats  on the billi keep shining even brighter lets take time to appreciate the fact that tiktok didnt ruin this song only real fans here before 1 billion and after  my girlfriend disliked this song now she is my ex my son sean used to love this song he is the one who got me listening to chris brown he was killed by one of his best friends 4 years ago because of
